## About <a name = "about"></a>

Alexeyevna is a Discord bot that I run on my personal servers.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

It's a discord bot. Not much to it.

## Config File <a name = "config"></a>

For this bot to run, it requires a config file "botconf.json" in /src/. 
The properties in that JSON file are:
- "prefix" : The bot's prefix. What it looks out for to get user commands.
- "token" : The bot's Discord App API token.
- "embedColour" : What colour it uses for message embeds.
- "version" : What version it currently is in.
