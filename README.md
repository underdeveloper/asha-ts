# asha_ts [DEPRECATED]

This rendition of Alexeyevna has been deprecated, due to updates to the Discord.JS module. DJSv13 has rendered features of this code unusable and other updates to appendage modules have also made dangerous vulnerabilities. This repository is kept only for archival purposes.

## About <a name = "about"></a>

Alexeyevna is a Discord bot that I run on my personal servers.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

It's a discord bot. Not much to it.

## Config File <a name = "config"></a>

For this bot to run, it requires a config file "botconf.json" in /src/. 
The properties in that JSON file are:
- "prefix" : The bot's prefix. What it looks out for to get user commands.
- "token" : The bot's Discord App API token.
- "embedColour" : What colour it uses for message embeds.
- "version" : What version it currently is in.
- "ownerID" : The user ID of the bot owner.
